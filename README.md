## Description: 

         In this project we have created a PWA style budget tracker which can be used in online or offline mode. As the budget imputs are taken offline, they will be held in the app until you go online again, at this time your inputs will be pushed to the database.

## Installation:

         This is a simple heroku app so there is no installation needed.

## Usage:

         Upon opening the app you may save it to your home screen on a mobile device. From there follow the simple prompts and enter a transaction name and dollar amount. You will see your value rise and fall along with a graph showing the transactions.
